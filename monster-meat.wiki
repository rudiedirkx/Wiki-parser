'''Monster Meat''' is a [[Food]] item obtained by killing most [[Monsters]]. Most monsters will drop Monster Meat at least 50% of the time, otherwise dropping their special resources (for example [[Spiders]] also drop [[Silk]] and [[Spider Gland]]).  Although edible, it is toxic and will reduce [[Health]] and [[Sanity]] when consumed, with the exception of Webber, who will not take any penalties upon consumption.

==Cooked Monster Meat==
'''Cooked Monster Meat''' is Monster Meat that has been [[cooking|cooked]] on a [[Campfire]], [[Fire Pit]] or [[Star Caller's Staff|Star]]. It can also be put in a [[Crock Pot]] to be used in multiple [[Crock Pot Recipes|recipes]].
[[Mobs]] that ordinarily drop Monster Meat and die from being set on fire, will drop a Cooked Monster Meat instead.
Cooking Monster Meat on a Campfire/Fire Pit or drying it on a [[Drying Rack]] to make a [[Monster Jerky]] reduces its toxic effects. Additionally, ''one'' raw, cooked, or [[Monster Jerky|dried]] Monster Meat (or [[Durian]]) can be used as a [[meat]]/filler in Crock Pot recipes with no toxic effects. It should be noted however that using more than 1 piece of Monster Meat (or [[Durian]]) in a Crock Pot will typically result in [[Monster Lasagna]], which is just as toxic as eating raw monster meat, with a large sanity drain penalty.

Clowns asses are so funny!

And another paragraph to really illustrate clowns' funniness!
With a second sentence, which is not special?

And another with [[complex words]].

==Usage {{pic|32|Icon Tools}} usagE==
Monster Meat can be used as bait for meat-eating creatures, such as [[Spiders]] or [[Buzzards]]. Giving Monster Meat to a [[Pig]] will befriend it.  When 4 pieces of Monster Meat are fed to a [[Pig]], it will transform into a [[Werepig]] and become hostile. This can sometimes happen accidentally when [[Pig Village]]s are close to [[Spider Dens]], as Pigs will eat the Monster Meat from [[Spiders]] they kill.
Cooked Monster Meat or Monster Jerky can be fed to [[birdcage|caged birds]] to produce [[egg]]s. A single piece of Monster Meat can be used in a number of Crock Pot recipes without producing side-effects. One of the best ways to use up large quantities of Monster Meat is by cooking [[Bacon and Eggs]] or [[Fishsticks]] which can use up 2 pieces per dish.
Monster Meat farming is a very practical thing to do especially in the earlier stages of the game because it is very easy and effective.

=={{pic|32|Placeholder}} Trivia==
*Contrary to popular belief, [[WX-78]] still takes damage when it eats this.
*Monster Meat is possibly the greatest of the Crock Pot ingredients/fillers, as it has a meat value of 1, can be turned into jerky and can be made into [[Eggs]] with a [[Bird Cage]]. This makes it possible to survive off of Monster Meat alone by cooking Meatballs with Monster Meat and Eggs. If a player has access to morsels, Bacon and Eggs can also be made, and is a more beneficial recipe than Meatballs.
*When playing as [[Wolfgang]], it is possible to gain more health from being mighty than lost from eating cooked monster meat. Though when going back to normal his health will be lower than it was.
*[[Webber]] starts with 2 Monster Meat and suffers no Health or sanity penalties when eating it. Unlike other characters, cooking the Monster Meat before consuming it provides no bonuses to Webber aside from increased spoiling time.
* Despite not actually being a monster, [[Glommer]] drops Monster Meat upon death.
